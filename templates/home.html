<p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes 
that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus
 Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the
 western gorillas (both critically endangered), and either four or five subspecies.
 They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans,
 from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans 
 after the chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>

<p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or
 subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although
 their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan
 Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. 
 The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests 
 of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres 
 (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes
 as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern 
 lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.[2]</p>

 <h2><a name="a">Etymology</a></h2>
 <p>The word "gorilla" comes from the history of Hanno
 the Navigator, (c. 500 BC) a Carthaginian explorer 
 on an expedition on the west African coast to the 
 area that later became Sierra Leone.[3][4] Members 
 of the expedition encountered "savage people, the 
 greater part of whom were women, whose bodies were hairy,
 and whom our interpreters called Gorillae".[5][6] It
 is unknown whether what the explorers encountered were
 what we now call gorillas, another species of ape or
 monkeys, or humans.[7] Skins of gorillai women, brought
 back by Hanno, are reputed to have been kept at Carthage
 until Rome destroyed the city 350 years later at the end
 of the Punic Wars, 146 BC.
 </p>
 <p>The American physician and missionary Thomas Staughton
 Savage and naturalist Jeffries Wyman first described the 
 western gorilla (they called it Troglodytes gorilla)
 in 1847 from specimens obtained in Liberia.[8] 
 The name was derived from Ancient Greek Γόριλλαι 
 (gorillai), meaning 'tribe of hairy women',[9] described 
 by Hanno.

 <h2><a name="b">Evolution and classification</a></h2>
 <p>The closest relatives of gorillas are the other two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago.[10] Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has.[11] Until recently, gorillas were considered to be a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla.[7][12] There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other.[2]</p>

<p>Primatologists continue to explore the relationships between various gorilla populations.[7] The species and subspecies listed here are the ones upon which most scientists agree</p>

		<p>Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distances while carrying food or in defensive situations,[15] and some mountain gorillas use other parts of their hand to aid locomotion (studies of 77 mountain gorillas published in 2018 showed 61% only used knuckle walking, but the remainder used knuckle walking plus other parts of their hand—fist walking in ways that do not use the knuckles, using the backs of their hand, and using their palms).[16] There is individual variation in the frequency and ease with which gorillas walk upright; certain gorillas at Philadephia Zoo and London Zoo have been observed walking upright more frequently and for longer distances than normal, with one gorilla at the Philadelphia Zoo often doing so to avoid getting mud on his hands.[17] Wild male gorillas weigh 136 to 227 kg (300 to 500 lb), while adult females weigh 68–113 kg (150–250 lb).[18][19]</p>
		<p>Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei)
		<p>Adult males are 1.4 to 1.8 m (4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, with an arm span that stretches from 2.3 to 2.6 m (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Female gorillas are shorter at 1.25 to 1.5 m (4 ft 1 in to 4 ft 11 in), with smaller arm spans.[20][21][22][23] Groves (1970) calculated the average weight of 47 wild adult male gorillas at 143 kg, while Smith and Jungers (1997) found the average weight of 19 wild adult male gorillas to be 170 kg.[24][25] Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips. The tallest gorilla recorded was a 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) silverback with an arm span of 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in), a chest of 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in), and a weight of 219 kg (483 lb), shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938.[23] The heaviest gorilla recorded was a 1.83 m (6 ft 0 in) silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon, which weighed 267 kg (589 lb).[23] Males in captivity can be overweight and reach weights up to 310 kg (683 lb).[23] Gorilla facial structure is described as mandibular prognathism, that is, the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla. Adult males also have a prominent sagittal crest.</p>
		<p>The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla.[26]</p>
		<p>Studies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies, which would, in humans, indicate type O blood. Due to novel sequences, though, it is different enough to not conform with the human ABO blood group system, into which the other great apes fit.[27] Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints.[28][29] Their eye colour is dark brown, framed by a black ring around the iris.</p>

 <h2><a name="d">Disribution and habitat</a></h2>
 <p>Gorillas have a patchy distribution. The range of the two species is separated by the Congo River and its tributaries. The western gorilla lives in west central Africa, while the eastern gorilla lives in east central Africa. Between the species, and even within the species, gorillas live in a variety of habitats and elevations. Gorilla habitat ranges from montane forest to swampland. Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forest between 650 and 4,000 m (2,130 and 13,120 ft) above sea level.[30] Mountain gorillas live in montane forest at the higher end of the elevation range, while eastern lowland gorillas live in submontane forest at the lower end. In addition, eastern lowland gorillas live in montane bamboo forest, as well as lowland forest ranging from 600–3,308 m (1,969–10,853 ft) in elevation.[31] Western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forest and montane forest, at elevations ranging from sea level to 1,600 m (5,200 ft).[30] Western lowland gorillas live in swamp and lowland forest ranging up to 1,600 m (5,200 ft), and Cross River gorillas live in low-lying and submontane forest ranging from 150–1,600 m (490–5,250 ft).</p>
